# WindowsKeyRemapper
**WindowsKeyRemapper** is a small Win32-based utility that lets you redefine up to **five** simultaneous key-to-key mappings on Windows. It provides a simple visual UI, a toggle hotkey to enable/disable remapping at runtime, and a reset button to clear all mappings. Mappings persist across sessions in a JSON file (`mappings.json`).
